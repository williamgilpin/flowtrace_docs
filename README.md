# flowtrace

A simple tool for visualizing unsteady flows.

#### Installation

Flowtrace is currently implemented in Python, MATLAB, and Fiji/ImageJ, please choose your preferred version below for installation and usage instructions

#### Publications

This tool was created by William Gilpin, Vivek N. Prakash, and Manu Prakash, 2015-2017. For more details and comparison to other tools (such as Finite-Time Lyapunov exponents) please see our paper in [Journal of Experimental Biology](https://doi.org/10.1101/086140).
